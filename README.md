*An integrity-enforced investigative journalism platform.*

---

## What Is This?

A subscription-based platform where:

- Independent journalists publish first-hand investigative reporting
- Revenue flows to journalists, not the platform
- Integrity is enforced through reputation, not editorial control
- Readers get high-signal journalism with clear provenance

**We are a platform, not a publisher.** We don't write or edit content. We enforce standards through economic incentives and process transparency.

## Core Idea

> Any account that publicly validates a claim assumes the same responsibility and consequences as if it had published the claim itself.

This closes the "liability gap" in most media systems, where original posters bear risk but amplifiers and fact-checkers do not.

## Key Principles

1. **Platform, not publisher** — We host, we don't edit
2. **Truth is a process** — "Supported/disputed/insufficient," never "true/false"
3. **Verification is publication** — Validators inherit author liability
4. **Identity where it matters** — Verified humans, pseudonymous bylines
5. **Incentives over intentions** — Design for alignment, not good faith

## MVP Scope (Phase 1)

- Paid subscription (web + app)
- Journalist identity verification (Jumio)
- Article submission with required sourcing
- Reputation-weighted distribution
- Flagging, labels, corrections
- Revenue sharing to journalists

**Deferred to v2+:** Knowledge graph, wiki layer, community validation

## Status

🟡 **Pre-development** — Validating assumptions through outreach

### Next Steps

1. Resolve blocking open questions
2. Conduct adversarial feedback conversations (Tier 1 contacts)
3. Finalize technical architecture
4. Begin MVP development
