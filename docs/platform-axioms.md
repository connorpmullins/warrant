# Platform Axioms

_Core principles that guide all product, policy, and technical decisions._

---

## 1. Platform, Not Publisher

We do not write, commission, or substantively edit journalists' claims. We enforce standards via:

- gating
- labeling
- downranking
- removal
- account actions

**Why this matters:** Preserves Section 230 protection. The moment we co-author content, we inherit liability for it.

---

## 2. Truth Is a Process, Not a Badge

We never claim omniscience. We never say "verified true."

Instead, we use process-based states:

- **Supported** — multiple credible sources align
- **Disputed** — credible counter-evidence exists
- **Insufficient sourcing** — claim lacks adequate backing
- **Correction issued** — original claim modified by author

**Why this matters:** Claiming truth invites liability and erodes trust when we're wrong. Process language is defensible and honest.

---

## 3. Verification Is Publication

Any account that publicly validates a claim assumes the **same responsibility and consequences** as if it had published the claim itself.

- Posting false information → penalty
- Validating false information → **identical penalty**

This collapses the moral and reputational distinction between _author_ and _endorser_.

**Why this matters:** Closes the "liability gap" where low-reputation actors post risky claims and high-reputation actors "verify" them cheaply. Makes endorsement a scarce, high-stakes action.

---

## 4. Identity Where It Matters

- **Readers** can be pseudonymous
- **Revenue-earning contributors** must be verified humans (government ID + liveness check)

Verification grants an internal "Verified Human" credential without forcing public real-name display.

**Why this matters:** Enables accountability for bans (real consequences) while protecting journalist safety through pseudonymous bylines.

---

## 5. Reversibility + Auditability

Every claim and edit is:

- **Attributable** — tied to an account
- **Versioned** — full history preserved
- **Reversible** — can be rolled back

**Why this matters:** Enables dispute resolution, prevents silent memory-holing, creates accountability trail.

---

## 6. Separate Lanes of Speech

Journalist content is clearly attributed to journalists. Platform speech is limited to:

- Labels
- Integrity notices
- Policy explanations

We never say "We investigated..." or "Our reporting proves..."

We always say "Author X reports..." or "This claim is supported by..."

**Why this matters:** Maintains the author-platform distinction that protects Section 230 status.

---

## 7. Enforcement Is Distributed, Not Centralized

Risk is distributed through the reputation system, not concentrated in a moderation team making editorial calls.

- Validators stake reputation on claims
- Bad validation propagates backward through the graph
- The system self-corrects through economic and reputational incentives

**Why this matters:** Scales better than centralized moderation. Avoids single points of capture or bias.

---

## 8. Incentives Over Intentions

We design for incentive alignment, not good intentions.

- Revenue tied to integrity metrics, not just engagement
- Distribution privilege earned through track record
- Penalties have real economic consequences

**Why this matters:** Good intentions don't survive contact with scale. Incentives do.

## One-Sentence Summary

> A platform that enforces journalistic integrity through economic incentives, reputation stakes, and process transparency—without becoming a publisher.
