## 1. Summary

Build a paid subscription platform (web + mobile) that:

- Hosts independent journalists' first-hand reporting
- Enforces journalistic integrity via process gating, reputation, and distribution controls
- Routes most subscription revenue to verified journalists
- Uses a lightweight "wisdom of crowds" mechanism for product evolution (advisory, not editorial)

**Key constraint:** Platform posture only. We do not publish our own content.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Reader Problem

Readers who will pay for news want:

- High-signal investigative reporting
- Clear provenance and sourcing
- Confidence that falsehoods are punished and corrected
- Understanding of "what we know" vs "what's disputed"

### Journalist Problem

Independent journalists want:

- A credible distribution channel
- Fair monetization without ad incentives
- Protection against engagement gaming
- Tools that make sourcing and credibility legible to readers

### Ecosystem Problem

Digital media incentives reward:

- Speed over verification
- Outrage/engagement over truth
- Low accountability for repeat inaccuracies

**This product shifts incentives** by coupling distribution privilege, economic reward, and reputation to demonstrated integrity.

## 3. Goals

1. Enable subscription-paid consumption and sharing of high-quality investigative work (web + iOS/Android)
2. Route most subscription revenue to verified journalists publishing first-hand reporting
3. Enforce integrity through:
   - Clear sourcing requirements
   - Corrections workflow
   - Reputation-weighted distribution
   - Penalties for repeated unsupported claims
4. Provide lightweight product feedback/voting space (advisory only)

---

## 4. Non-Goals (v1)

- ❌ We are not an editorial newsroom commissioning investigations
- ❌ We are not guaranteeing factual truth of all content
- ❌ We are not doing real-time breaking-news feed optimization
- ❌ We are not implementing binding governance over editorial policy
- ❌ We are not allowing anonymous, unverified users to publish first-hand allegations
- ❌ We are not building the knowledge graph / wiki layer (deferred to v2)

## 5. Personas

### Reader / Subscriber

- Pays monthly/annual
- Reads, saves, shares
- Can flag issues, suggest corrections, vote on product features

### Verified Journalist (First-hand Contributor)

- Verified human identity (government ID + liveness)
- Publishes first-hand reporting under author profile
- Earns revenue share
- Subject to integrity scoring and penalties

### Platform Integrity Ops (Internal)

- Handles escalations: defamation-risk flags, abuse, repeated policy violations

---
