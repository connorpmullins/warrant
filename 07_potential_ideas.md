## Non-Personalized Feed Option

**Problem:** Personalized content streams create echo chambers by reinforcing existing beliefs and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Even with strong integrity enforcement and validation systems, algorithmic personalization can still funnel readers toward content that confirms their worldview.

**Idea:** Ensure at least one primary, non-personalized content stream is always available.

### Possible Approaches

1. **Default to chronological/editorial** — The main feed shows content based on recency, reputation score, or editorial importance — not user behavior or preferences.

2. **Personalization as opt-in** — If personalization exists at all, it's a conscious choice users make, not the default experience.

3. **"Common Ground" feed** — A curated stream specifically designed to show the same content to all users, creating shared context across the readership.

4. **Transparency about any sorting** — If any algorithmic ranking is used, make the criteria explicit and auditable.

### Why This Matters

- **Shared reality:** Democracy requires some common information substrate. If everyone sees different "news," there's no basis for collective reasoning.
- **Integrity through friction:** Personalization optimizes for engagement; non-personalization optimizes for importance. The latter aligns better with journalism's purpose.
- **Trust signal:** "We don't manipulate what you see" is a powerful differentiator from ad-driven platforms.

### Open Questions

- Does this conflict with reputation-weighted distribution?
- How do we handle volume if the feed isn't filtered?
- Is "personalization" different from "relevance" (e.g., local news)?
