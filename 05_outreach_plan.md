# Outreach & Validation Plan

*Who to talk to, what to learn, and how to de-risk the idea before building.*

---

## 1. Outreach Philosophy

The goal is **de-risking**, not validation.

Before broad outreach, do 3-5 private, adversarial conversations where the explicit instruction is:

> "Assume this fails. Tell me how."

If everyone agrees with the premise, you'll miss blind spots.

---

## 2. Tiered Contact List

### Tier 0 — High-Signal Validators

These people won't join casually. If they respond at all, you've passed a seriousness threshold.

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Maria Ressa** | Rappler / Philippines | Can this survive hostile governments? |
| **Shoshana Zuboff** | Academia | Does this accidentally recreate surveillance capitalism? |
| **Bruce Schneier** | Security / cryptography | Is the anonymity + identity story naïve? |

### Tier 1 — Builder-Critics (Most Important)

These people have built or broken things adjacent to your idea.

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Dan Fletcher, Dmitri Cherniak, Adrian Sanders** | Beacon | Why isn't Beacon enough? Where are real bottlenecks? |
| **Frances Haugen** | Former Meta | Can process constraints overpower growth incentives? |
| **Meredith Whittaker** | Signal / former Google | Can values-driven platforms scale without rot? |
| **Stephen Engelberg** | ProPublica Editor in Chief | Does this fit how investigative journalism actually works? |
| **Charles Ornstein** | ProPublica (Local Reporting Network) | Would independent journalists adopt this? |
| **Tyson Evans** | ProPublica Chief Product Officer | Does the product/tech architecture make sense? |

### Tier 2 — Journalists Who Understand Failure

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Ronan Farrow** | Independent | Does this protect reporters from their own publishers? |
| **Carole Cadwalladr** | UK | Legal exposure, platform abandonment, reputational fragility |
| **Ben Smith** | Semafor / former BuzzFeed | Do the economics actually work? |

### Tier 3 — Epistemic & Governance Skeptics

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Jay Rosen** | NYU | Audience trust, legitimacy, narrative framing |
| **Ethan Zuckerman** | Academia | Do alternative media ecosystems inevitably fragment? |
| **Marietje Schaake** | EU governance | Regulatory survivability outside the US |

### Tier 4 — Controlled Opposition

You want at least one person who disagrees with core premises.

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Glenn Greenwald** | Independent / Substack | Does enforcement inevitably become ideological? |
| **Seymour Hersh** | Long-form journalism | Does reputational gating prevent decline or just delay it? |

---

## 3. Trust & Innovation Ecosystem

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Sally Lehrman** | The Trust Project | Do transparency mechanisms actually change behavior? |

---

## 5. Decentralized Protocol & Trust Experts

These people have built identity, trust, and safety systems for decentralized networks — a unique perspective your other contacts don't have.

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Ross Schulman** | New America's Open Technology Institute / Matrix Guardian | Legal + decentralization + surveillance. Is the identity/anonymity architecture legally coherent? |
| **Jim Mackenzie** | Matrix.org VP of Trust & Safety | Has built T&S for decentralized protocols. What breaks in practice? |
| **Denise Almeida** | Matrix.org DPO (PhD: privacy/privilege/tech) | Privacy vs. accountability tension. Does the identity model create new risks? |
| **Matthew Hodgson** | Matrix co-founder / Element CTO | Technical architecture for federated identity. Is verification sound at protocol level? |
| **Prof. Jon Crowcroft** | Cambridge / Matrix Guardian | Decentralized communication pioneer. Does the structure avoid known failure modes? |
| **Travis Ralston** | Matrix Director of Standards Development | Governance process expertise. Do oversight mechanisms match how standards bodies maintain integrity? |

---

## 6. Investigative Journalism Operations (ProPublica)

These people have built and run one of the most successful investigative nonprofit newsrooms. They know what actually works in practice.

| Person | Where | What They Test |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Stephen Engelberg** | ProPublica Editor in Chief | Founding editor since 2008. Does this fit real investigative journalism workflows? |
| **Tracy Weber** | ProPublica Managing Editor | Oversees landmark projects. Can process-based integrity substitute for editorial control? |

| **Tyson Evans** | ProPublica Chief Product & Brand Officer | Oversees product, tech, design, audience. Does the platform architecture make sense? |
| **Ken Schwencke** | ProPublica Sr. Editor, Data & News Apps | Data journalism leadership. Can verification systems scale without friction? |
| **Alexandra Zayas** | ProPublica Deputy Managing Editor | Oversees data journalists and news apps. What does workflow integration look like? |
| **Jeremy Kutner** | ProPublica General Counsel | Litigated libel cases. Is the liability model legally sound? |
| **Ariana Tobin** | ProPublica Engagement Editor | Audience engagement expertise. Do readers actually want provenance and transparency? |

## 7. Assumption → Challenger Map

This is the critical artifact. For each core assumption, identify who will break it.

### Assumption A: "We can verify journalists and still protect anonymity"

**Challengers:** Bruce Schneier, Meredith Whittaker, Maria Ressa, Ross Schulman, Denise Almeida, Matthew Hodgson

**Failure mode:** Identity systems leak eventually. Reporters pay the price.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who holds the keys?
- What happens under subpoena?
- Can the system degrade safely?

---

### Assumption B: "Enforcement + bans will meaningfully improve integrity"

**Challengers:** Glenn Greenwald, Jay Rosen, Jim Mackenzie

**Failure mode:** Enforcement becomes politics-by-proxy.

**Questions to ask:**
- What exactly gets banned: behavior, outcomes, intent, or process violations?
- Who decides edge cases?

---

### Assumption C: "A social layer won't corrupt incentives"

**Challengers:** Shoshana Zuboff, Frances Haugen

**Failure mode:** Soft virality quietly reintroduces engagement chasing.

**Questions to ask:**
- What happens when audiences reward bad incentives even if the platform doesn't?

---

### Assumption D: "Journalists want this badly enough to change workflows"

**Challengers:** Ben Smith, Ethan Zuckerman, Stephen Engelberg, Charles Ornstein, Tracy Weber

**Failure mode:** Journalists agree in principle but default to existing distribution.

**Questions to ask:**
- What does this replace, day one?
- What's the immediate pain it solves?

---

### Assumption E: "Process legitimacy can substitute for institutional brand"

**Challengers:** Ronan Farrow, Carole Cadwalladr, Ariana Tobin

**Failure mode:** In controversy, audiences trust names, not systems.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's your legitimacy story when the first scandal hits?

---

### Assumption F: "This won't be captured over time"

**Challengers:** Seymour Hersh, Marietje Schaake, Prof. Jon Crowcroft, Travis Ralston

**Failure mode:** Gradual rule-drift under legal, financial, or political pressure.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who is empowered to say "no" when money, growth, or governments push?

---

## 8. Outreach Framing

### Don't Pitch It As
- "A better moderation system"
- "A fairer Twitter"
- "An oversight body for journalism"

### Do Pitch It As
- "An attempt to learn from why even well-designed governance systems fail under pressure"
- "A structural experiment in aligning incentives with integrity"

### The Ask

People like Maria Ressa are far more willing to answer:

> "Is this fatally flawed?"

Than:

> "What do you think?"

Because:
- It respects their time
- It treats them as an expert, not a resource
- It gives them an easy out
- It doesn't imply commitment

---

## 9. Outreach Sequence

### Phase 1: Adversarial Feedback (Before Building)
- 3-5 private conversations
- Focus on Tier 1 (builders) and key skeptics
- Instruction: "Assume this fails. Tell me how."

### Phase 2: Credibility Signals (During MVP)
- Reach out to Tier 0 (high-signal validators)
- Share progress, not just pitch
- Ask for specific feedback on specific problems

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Building (Post-Launch)
- Trust & innovation ecosystem
- Journalism organizations
- Potential contributor journalists
